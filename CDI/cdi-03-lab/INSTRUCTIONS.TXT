CDI Producer/Disposer, lab 03
Let's implement simple CDI producer and disposer class for stateful object.
It is necessary to have custom stateful object injectable by CDI framework.

1. Create StateHolder class in ite.examples.cdi.producer package, use class from cdi-03-solution project

2. Create StatefulObjectProducer class in ite.examples.cdi.producer package with @Dependent scope and 
   implement methods 
   private StateHolder createStatefulObject();
   private void destroyStatefulObject(@Disposes StateHolder sh);
   
3. Inject StateHolder into ite.examples.cdi.producer.RequestScopedBean bean using CDI annontation

4. change states of the StateHolder object instance in @PostConstruct method
   you may use commended code inside RequestScopedBean class

5. deploy the application and with each reload of http://localhost:8080/cdi-03-lab/ page
   creation and disposal of StateHolder instance is visible in server log.
