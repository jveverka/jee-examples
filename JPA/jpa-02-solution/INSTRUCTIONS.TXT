JPA Lab 02 
This is simple CRUD demo using single database entity.
Architecture:
- ite.examples.jpa.crud.dto - package for Data Transfer Objects
- ite.examples.jpa.crud.entities - JPA entities
- ite.examples.jpa.crud.ui - Client Tier, User Interface Backing beans (JSF), PUSH stuff, ...
- ite.examples.jpa.crud.services - Application Tier or Transactional Tier, EJB beans of the UserDataService 

Client Bean Hierarchy:
[UserViewClientBean][UI]
  |
  +--[UserDataService][EJB]{SLSB}
      |
      +--[UserManagerBean][EJB]{SLSB}
      |   |
      |   +--[UserMDBClientBean][EJB]{SLSB}   
      |
      +--[UserQueryBean][EJB]{SLSB}

Transactional behavior 01:
1. in ite.examples.jpa.crud.services.UserDataService, put annotation  
   @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
   on method createUserAction(...)
2. re-deploy and try to create new user via UI
3. UI shows exception, Why ?

Transactional behavior 02:
1. in ite.examples.jpa.crud.services.UserDataService, throw an exception 
   as last line of method createUserAction(...) 
   throw new NullPointerException();
2. re-deploy and try to create new user via UI
3. There is no user created in the database, no JMS Topic message has been send. Why? 

Transactional behavior 03:
1. in ite.examples.jpa.crud.services.UserDataService, throw an exception 
   as last line of method createUserAction(...) 
   throw new DemoException();
2. re-deploy and try to create new user via UI
3. UI get an exception, however there is user created in the database and JMS Topic message has been send. Why?
4. Annotate DemoException with @ApplicationException(rollback=true)
5. re-deploy and try to create new user via UI
6. There is no user created in the database, no JMS Topic message has been send. Why? 
   
Transactional behavior 04:  
1. Use SessionContext.setRollbackOnly() to abort transaction.
2. Hint: @Resource SessionContext 

Transactional behavior 05:
1. Turn off transactional behavior of the UserDataService completely (use BMT)
2. use @Resource UserTransaction
3. repeat excercises 02, 03
